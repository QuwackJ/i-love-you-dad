        <p>In all seriousness, thank you so much for being such an amazing dad!</p>
        <p>I know I don't say this enough, but I seriously appreciate everything you do for our happiness, health, and safety. I always hope to be just as witty, hardworking, kind, and intelligent as you when I'm an adult. (I don't know if any of that rambling made any sense, but my point is that I love you and am grateful for everything that you do!)</p>
        <p>Also, I hope you like the pickle card and enjoy the rest of your birthday week with lots of love, muffins, coffee, and Seinfeld!</p>
